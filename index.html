        <p>I'm Dominik Kulawiak and am currently a 4th year student at IIT. Taking this class, I hope to learn a lot about front & back end development; full stack. There's so many important skills to learn and it's exciting to see what's to come.</p>
        <p>Being at IIT for 4 years now, I developed a new drive to learn ITM more in depth. So far it's been really interesting and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>

        <h2>Web Experience</h2>
        <p>My web experience is fairly alright; I feel as if I have been exposed well enough to the inner workings of a webpage and all its mechanisms but there are many things that need to be learned. Some of the concepts that I have delt with include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Marking up in HTML5</li>
          <li>Designing with CSS</li>
          <li>Basic JavaScript functions</li>
          <li>Hosting both: through GitHub Pages as well as a VPS</li>
          <li>Setting up content managers such as WordPress</li>
          <li>Understanding media compression and a website cache </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
        <p>Food as well as the process of making it has always been a big part of my interest and I've enjoyed all forms of it. I like cooking just as much as I love trying new foods and learning about them. Cooking shows were some of my favorites growing up, especially the ones that featured Gordon Ramsey. Even though the shows involved a lot of yelling, it created a new sense of appreciation for how the food is made and the effort that goes into it.</p>
        <p>Over time I've come to like the taste of a few foods more than others, some of these foods include:</p>
        <ul class="short-lists">
          <li>A well-made, loaded burger</li>
          <li>Calamari</li>
          <li>A well-seasoned steak</li>
          <li>Delicious tacos</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="media/tacos.jpg" alt="A picture of tacos with carne asada (steak), cilantro, onions">
        <p>These are just some of the few favorite foods. I usually try to keep it fresh and a little different each time so that no food becomes too boring to me.</p>

      <section id="skydiving">
        <h2>Skydiving</h2>
        <p>One of the coolest things I have ever done is skydived. In fact, it was so enjoyable that after I went once, it was only necessary to repeat going to it two years later. It really is a feeling that cannot be explained. Both times, my skydive experience was with Skydive Midwest, which did a great job making me feel comfortable, yet being able to enjoy myself.</p>
        <p>Here's a couple of the <strong>dangers</strong> I found most compelling:</p>
        <ul class="short-lists">
          <li>The parachutes might not deploy at all.</li>
          <li>The company is not responsible for employee negligence.</li>
          <li>The harness can snap/break at any given moment.</li>
        </ul>
